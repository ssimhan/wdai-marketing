### Block B: Approval Status Tracking ✅

- [x] Status integration into pipeline + HTML viewer badges

### Block C: Vercel Deployment + Auth ⏳ deferred
- [ ] Deploy vault/ as static site, vercel.json config
- [ ] Vercel Authentication (magic links, whitelisted team emails)

### Block D: Slack Interactive Approval ✅
- [x] Approve/Edit buttons on Slack messages (D1)
- [x] Vercel serverless endpoint for button callbacks → updates status via GitHub API (D2 — completed as part of Phase 5)

## Phase 5: Copy Generation + Per-Leader Approval ✅
### Block A: Copy Data Model ✅
- [x] Copy data model + flat-file storage (vault/promos/<event-id>/)
- [x] CopyDraft, CopyStatus types with approval workflow fields
- [x] copy-store.ts: read/write YAML for per-event copy

### Block B: Voice Guides ✅
- [x] voice-loader.ts loads brand, LinkedIn, Helen voice guides from vault
- [x] Graceful fallback for missing files (returns empty string)

### Block C: Prompt Building ✅
- [x] prompt-builder.ts combines event + moment + voice guides into system/user prompts
- [x] Channel-specific voice injection (LinkedIn, Slack, email)

### Block D: Copy Generation (partial) ✅
- [x] copy-generator.ts calls Anthropic API (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)
- [x] generate.ts CLI: `calendar generate-copy --event <id> --channel <channel>`
- [x] Timeout + retry logic (60s, single retry)
- [x] Skips moments with existing approved copy

### Block E: HTML Viewer Integration ✅
- [x] Copy display in calendar HTML viewer (status badges, copy panels)
- [x] renderChannelPlanMd() shows copy excerpt alongside moment plan
- [x] copyStatusBadge() shows 🔲/🟡/✅/📤 status

### Block F: Slack Interactions ✅
- [x] Vercel serverless endpoint (api/slack/interactions.ts)
- [x] Slack signature verification (timing-safe HMAC-SHA256)
- [x] Handle "approve" action: fetch status file, update, PUT via GitHub API
- [x] vercel.json routing + environment variable configuration
- [x] 11 comprehensive unit tests for signature, GitHub ops, routing

## HTML Viewer UX Improvements (small tweaks, no phase dependency)
- [ ] Hide past events by default in By Date and By Event tabs; add "Show past events" toggle button to reveal them
- [ ] Slack moments should show which specific WDAI Slack channel to post in (e.g. #general, #announcements) and the name of the person responsible — visible before approving the plan

## Phase 5B: Leader Voice Integration
- [ ] Once leader voice skills are onboarded, copy-generator.ts should load the DRI's personal voice skill (e.g. vault/skills/voice-helen/) in addition to brand guidelines — so generated copy sounds like the person posting it, not just the org

## Phase 6: Auto-Publishing (org channels only)
- [ ] WDAI LinkedIn auto-post (org page API token)
- [ ] Mailchimp draft creation (hooks into existing wdai-mc system)
- [ ] Mailchimp auto-send (optional, behind a flag)
- [ ] Publishing status tracked in vault

## Phase 7: Leader Onboarding + Handoff
- [ ] Personal LinkedIn OAuth flow per leader
- [ ] Voice skill calibration per leader
- [ ] Docs, maintenance runbook
- [ ] Team training on the content calendar
